<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class defines a vector whith its x, y, z and w components. This
values are calculated from 2 Vertex object (see Vertex documentation).

An instance can be constructed from a array with this keys :
new Vector(array("dest" => vertex1 [, "orig" => vertex2]));

Where vertex1 and vertex2 are two instances of the Vertex's class. Vertex2 is
optionnal, its default value is a vertex with x=0, y=0, z=0 and w=1.

The class provides read only accessors and the following methods :

float magnitude();
Returns the magnitude of vector.

Vector normalize();
Returns the normalized vector of instance in a new instance of Vector;

Vector add(Vector $rhs);
Add vectors and returns the new vector in a new instance of Vector;

Vector sub(Vector $rhs);
Sub vectors and returns the new vector in a new instance of Vector;

Vector opposite();
Returns the opposite of current vector in a new instance of Vector;

Vector scalarProduct($k);
Returns the dot product between current vector and a scalar in a new instance
of Vector;

Vector dotProduct(Vector $rhs);
Returns the dot product betwen the 2 vectors;

Vector cos(Vector $rhs);
Returns the cos between the 2 vectors;

Vector crossProduct(Vector $rhs);
Returns the cross product between ths 2 vectors in a new instance of Vector;
